									<h4>Custom Setup</h4>

									<p>Club Screen was designed in response to the growing demand for individualized web customization for organizations
									on campus. This app was built for students, by students. It's a more efficient way to ask for help, volunteer,
									and make the most of our time here at Michigan. </p>

									<h4>New Postings</h4>
									<p>The "Create Posting" button above navigates to a page that lets you specify what kind of skills your
										organization is looking for in an applicant. Is it officer election time? Do you need a math tutor, or are you
										a Glee Club searching for new talent? We've made it simpler; you can scrap those emailing lists and create a new posting!

								<h2>Clubs create a posting</h2>
								<p><!-- The Central Campus Student Government and Enactus have set this up as an alternative to long hours of mass meetings after
                                traditional org gatherings, and it's enabling a much faster, modern approach to campus involvement. We're using a simple email
                                protocol that keeps track of applicants and puts you directly in touch with whatever you've envisioned. -->
                                Visit the <a href="/newposting" target="_blank">create new posting page</a> and fill out the form describing the club postition. Check your UMich gmail and follow the link to activate your posting. Now your post is live and you will begin receiving emails from applicants!

								<h2>Students browse postings</h2>
								<p><!-- We think this is a great way to get involved with organizations, learn more about specific clubs at Michigan
                                    and apply directly to active postings you might be interested in, but one of the best perks is resume building!
                                If you've been wanting to add web development or leadership experiences to your resume for a while, there's never been
                                a better way to find them. -->
                                On the <a href="/postinglist" target="_blank">posting list page</a> you will find club positions to apply to. Sort the positions by different filter categories to find a perfect match. Simply click the apply button to see a detailed description of the posting.

                                If you want to apply to the position, fill out the form with your umich uniquename and add a short paragraph on why you're a good fit. That's it! Your application will be sent.

								At this point, uCLUBS has played its part. The club and student can communicate via UMich gmail. Maybe there is a more in depth application or interview process. Figure out the details on your own â€“ we're just here to make the initial match!</p>
